Mercado Libre Challenge!

This is an app that I developed as part of Mercado Libre's screening process. Is a simple react app created with create-react-app which fetches data from a local server developed on Node using Express and displays the results to the user.

So in order to run the app you just got to clone/download the project, install dependencies by using "npm i" on the CLI and after all dependencies have been installed, execute "npm run start:with-server" and that's it! both the local server and react app should be up and running.

Enjoy!
